## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment
1. Deploy `VillageSACCO.sol` to your chosen network
2. Update contract addresses in `/src/lib/web3.ts`
3. Verify contract on block explorer

### 3. Wallet Setup
1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Add testnet networks (Sepolia, Mumbai)
3. Get testnet ETH from faucets

### 4. Admin Setup
1. Deploy contract with admin address
2. Connect admin wallet to access blockchain admin features
3. Register initial members through blockchain admin panel

## User Flow

### For Members
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click wallet connection button in header
2. **Verify Membership**: Admin registers wallet address on blockchain
3. **Use Features**: Access blockchain savings, loans, and governance
4. **Participate**: Vote on proposals and manage funds

### For Admins
1. **Connect Admin Wallet**: Use wallet that deployed the contract
2. **Manage Members**: Register/remove member wallet addresses

3. **Transaction Failures**: Check gas fees and wallet balance
4. **Permission Errors**: Verify membership registration on blockchain

### Support Resources
- Smart contract source code in `/contracts/`
- Component documentation in code comments
- Web3 utilities in `/src/lib/web3.ts`
- Error messages provide specific guidance

## Testing

### Testnet Testing
1. Use Sepolia or Mumbai testnets
2. Get free testnet ETH from faucets
3. Deploy contract to testnet
4. Test all features with test funds

### Local Development
1. Run local blockchain (Hardhat/Ganache)
2. Deploy contract locally
3. Use local accounts for testing
4. Verify all functionality

This blockchain integration enhances the Village SACCO platform with transparent, secure, and decentralized financial services while maintaining compatibility with traditional banking operations.
